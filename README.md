# Direct Exoplanet Detection Using L1 Norm Low-Rank Approximation

This directory contains the codes of L1 norm low rank approximation for exoplanet detection by Angular Differential Imaging. Moreover, it contains an alternative ROC curve generation for direct exoplanet detection.

### CONTENTS:

* README: this file
* norm_lowrank.py: the main code for l1 and l2 norm low rank approximation (LRA) for direct imaging
* l1lracd.py: the functions for calculating l1 norm LRA 
* util.py: the utilized functions for our proposed algorithm
* build_roc_curve.py: our suggestion for building ROC curves.
* test_l1.ipynb: test of L1 and L2 norm for exoplanet detection as a detection map comparison.
* test_ROCcurves.ipynb: test ROC curve suggestion
